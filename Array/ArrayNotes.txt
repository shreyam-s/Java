=> Array -- An array is a collection of similar items stored in contiguous memory location.

=> Range of Index is [0, size-1]

=> What is contiguous memory allocation?
--A single cotiguous section/part of memory is allocated to the array.

size(int) = 4 bytes

=> Static VS Dynamic Arrays
Static Arrays -- It allocates memory at compile and its size is fixed.
Dynamic Arrays -- It automatically grows when we try to make insertion and there is no space left for new item.

=> Declaring an Array :
data_type name[] = new data_type[size];
For Ex -- int arr[] = new int[5];

=> Inserting an element:
name[index] = element;

=> Why does accessing an Array element takes O(1)?
-- address of ith index = Base address + offset
offset = i * (size of an element)
For Ex -- 2nd = 100 + (2 * 4) = 108
